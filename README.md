![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work_in_progress-orange)

This project aims to develop an AI agent capable of interacting with and playing Minecraft using the power of large language models. Currently in early development, this agent leverages **CodeLlama-7b-hf** to interpret game context and generate appropriate actions.

## ðŸš§ Current Status

**This project is actively under development and not yet functional for real gameplay.**  
Expect frequent changes, incomplete features, and experimental code.

## ðŸ§  Technology Stack

- **AI Model**: CodeLlama-7b-hf (Hugging Face)
- **Framework**: Python
- **Target Environment**: Minecraft (Java Edition via automation/API)
- **Dependencies**: Transformers, PyTorch, Minecraft automation tools (e.g., ADB, ComputerCraft, or custom mod interfaces)

> **Note**: A `requirements.txt` will be added as dependencies solidify.


Sample interaction:
```
User: "Create A Minecraft mod that does random events."
AI: [Creates a Mod in either Fabric or Forge and can run it in a enviroment state fixing any issues and adjustable]
```
